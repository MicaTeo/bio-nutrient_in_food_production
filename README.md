# Bio-nutrient in food production

**Goal**: The use of Earth Observation/Satellite data to understand soil and crop nutrient composition for improved application of bio-nutrient in food production

**Company**: IntelliDigest Ltd. (Ifey)

**Facilitator**: Cathal Cummins (Heriot-Watt University)

**Description**: IntelliDigest Ltd has set up the World Food tracker Platform to help stakeholders across the food
system in transitioning to a more sustainable food system through data insight.
For the farmers, data insight on crop and soil nutrient is essential in optimising the application of
nutrients during food production enabling them to move away from intensive agricultural practices.
However, soil sampling is costly and time-consuming. The processing of each field sample costs
around $24 without factoring in the expenses of personnel, storage and transportation cost.
Remote sensing and machine learning are useful techniques that can provide insight on crop and soil
health. With Earth Observation (EO) data, large regions may be covered, negating the requirement
for groundtruth data and greatly reducing the expense and duration of soil sensing.
Thus, the overall goal of this project is to access and study EO data and existing soil data to develop
an algorithm to determine the crop health and soil health.
